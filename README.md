# Matthew Hillier

Hey there! I'm an Aussie university student and full stack developer! I'm studying my [honours in IT at UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/find-a-course/bachelor-science-honours-information-technology) focusing on AR & VR, as well as working as a full stack web developer at [Helpwise](https://helpwise.com.au/).

Some technologies I enjoy working with include [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Angular](https://angular.io/), and [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).

I'm super keen about the future of AR & VR, and how they can work together to create engaging interactive experiences.
