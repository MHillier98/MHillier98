# Hello there!

I'm an Aussie university student studying [Information Technology at UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/future-students/find-a-course/bachelor-science-honours-information-technology) doing an Honours degree by research, focused on VR & AR interaction design. I'm also working as a full stack web developer at [Helpwise](https://helpwise.com.au/). I'm super keen about the future of VR and AR technologies and how they can work together to create engaging interactive experiences. Some of the tech I enjoy working with includes [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [Unity](https://unity.com/), [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and [Angular](https://angular.io/).
