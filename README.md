# Hello there!

### I'm a software engineer and hobbyist game developer

With a love for solving problems and writing code since a young age, I have been writing code for well over a decade, and professionally since 2017.

* Currently working at [Design.com](https://www.design.com/) (Jan 2022 - Present)
* Worked at [Helpwise](https://helpwise.com.au/) (Aug 2017 - Dec 2021)

Working on a Star Wars marathon / complete watch tracker as a hobby project: [WatchStarWars.app](https://www.watchstarwars.app/)

I completed a bachelor's degree and an honours research project at [UTS](https://www.uts.edu.au/) (2017 - 2021), where I studied information technology, designed and programmed 2D & 3D games, and wrote a thesis on interaction design for VR & AR user training in the same physical and digital locations.
